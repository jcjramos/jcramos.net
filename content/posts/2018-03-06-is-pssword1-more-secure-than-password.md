On the scope on the GDPR there was some recent news in Portugal regarding Government guidelines for online public services. Atually public service security is an important issue as in Portugal we have lot’s of personal info in public sites, for example a service call eFactura stores basically every invoice where you have put a VAT number – thus very valuable info.

The new guidelines are still under discussion, but a kind of pre-release showed up today in todays specialized press. Some of the measurements are basic security common sense like “Usage of plain text credentials in code or configuration files is forbidden” or  “there should be a access control policy defined”. Others are a bit odd like “Passwords should have a minimum length of 9 characters using lower and uppercase, numbers and special characters”.

This is kind of odd because for services that store such important data I would expect 2 factor authentication to be used and not just longer passwords. Actual longer passwords, or complex passwords are not exactly very secure, like Cormac Herley, Microsoft Researcher pointed out in a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/08/passwords-microsoft/">excellent wired article</a>.

“Try out enough <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/security/pc-security/password-checker.aspx">password-strength checkers</a>, and you'll get the impression that more is always better when it comes to password. But that's not really the case… Randomness is the key”

Thus the likely outcame is pointed by Donna Dodson NIST's chief cyber security advisor in the same article. "Putting the burden of security on the end-user and making it more complex just doesn't work," she says. "The security has to be usable for the end-user. Otherwise they're going to find workarounds."
