I really like this article I’ve read in Increment [The epistemology of software quality] ( https://increment.com/teams/the-epistemology-of-software-quality/ )

*Say you run a new team. You have carte blanche to implement any policies you want to make the team more productive and the code less buggy. What do you do? You could choose a new programming language, or switch everything to microservices, or follow the hottest trend in process. Or you could do things that matter. You could pace schedules. You could ensure that no one works more than eight hours a day. You could let people off 20 minutes early to avoid rush hour. You could make it as easy as possible for parents to take the day off when their kids are sick. You could make people feel like they’re important, because people are important. No method, tool, or language matters nearly as much as our own minds.*

I guess when you love technology It’s easy to get excited about language X, technology Y or methodology Z – the problem is that sometimes we tend to forget what is really, really, important when developing software. Software it’s made by people for other people !
Looking back in my already kind of long software development  career, the best projects I’ve worked with, the best ideas and innovations happen within motivated teams, although not always the brightest ones. On the other hand, I’ve often see very talented smart people, using state of the art technology and modern agile methodologies simply fail.

2019 was kind of a transaction here for me, my company is adopting  [Scaled Agile Framework ]( https://www.scaledagileframework.com/ ) and I move from a Architecture to a Agile Product Owner role,  as you can image when a large software organization adopts a new methodology there’s much discussion around practices – should we use more TDD ? how are our daily meetings ? do the teams have a proper DoD ?  this things can be important, but not as important as the people – have they the skills they need ? are they properly rewarded ? can people have a life or is the company expecting 60+h work weeks ? is there a healthy work environment or o toxic one ? do people understand what they are doing or they simply don’t care ? it’s easy for organizations to focus on things that might help and forget about the most important thing – people.
