In the recent decades the business model for the IT industry in Portugal was mostly a nearshoring model, much of the industry profits from the difference between IT salaries in Portugal vs central Europe. Knowing that the average salary in Portugal is roughly 50% lower than Germany and it’s just 1h time difference, it’s easy to understand that this can be a very lucrative model.

Things start to change during the Portuguese debt crisis during the early 2010’s, due to the dim opportunities at home many Portuguese youngsters moved to other European countries – moving abroad was particularly easy for the “IT crowd” given that their skills were in high demand abroad and usually it’s not a job requirement to know any other language besides English.  This together with the fact that Portugal is a member of the EU and people can basically just decide to move other country and work there without much hassle.

The emigration numbers were high but never high enough to significantly disrupt the industry, moving abroad is not for everyone and with time tired of living in a diferent country/culture with a lousy weather many did come back. Salaries in Portugal are lower but cost of live is also lower, an IT salary can easily be 2 or 3 times the average and you can still make a  good living here.  

But now a diferent trend seems to emerge, I don’t know the exact dimension, but seems to be getting significative. Now what happens is that the IT professionals are “nearshoring themselves”, basically working directly ( and remotely ) to European companies abroad. Seems a win/win situation,  companies get skilled people in a dificult market, they are already remote, so it’s not a big deal if your new employee is in Portugal - anyway he/she can travel to your office in central Europe in a few hours.  And people get a German or English wage with a Portuguese cost of living. 

No one knows what will be of the post pandemic world, bellow some of my guesses If this trend continues :
-	Typical Portuguese “consultancy” companies will have an hard time recruiting, many might close
-	Others might adapt by hiring remotely also, maybe “lusoshoring” ( outsourcing to lower cost Portuguese speaking countries like Brazil ? ) 
-	In Portugal we will have a high number of well paid ( by local terms ) IT professionals, although this is definitely good news for the involved ( and for many business ) it might be messy in terms of social cohesion.
-	Additionally a high number of “digital nomads” or just other IT people from diferent European countries working remotely might relocate to Portugal given the good climate and relatively safe environment.
-	The current IT industry in Portugal is mostly focused in Lisbon and Porto, with a few companies in Aveiro, Braga or Coimbra. With time remote professionals might be more widely spread through the country. 

Likelly the most relevant changes will be others that we do now forsee rigth now. Time will tell.
