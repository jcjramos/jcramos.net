*"Agile is an attitude, not a technique with boundaries." — Alistair Cockburn*

When I started my career as a developer we were a lean team of three, building TV ratings software. There were no "sprint commitments," no "PI Planning," and certainly no "Release Trains." We sat in a room, we understood the domain, and we shipped code. Communication overhead was effectively zero.
Meanwhile, things changed. Last years (decade?) we’ve been living in the era of "Uppercase Agile." We traded the original manifesto's spirit for the safety of massive frameworks—SAFe,  LeSS, and various "Enterprise" incarnations of what was meant to be a simple feedback loop. We built these scaffolds to solve a human problem: communication at scale is expensive.
But as we move into 2026, the tech landscape is shifting under our feet. We are moving from a world of "Managing People" to one of "Orchestrating Outcomes." And in this new world, the heavy frameworks aren't just redundant—they’re a liability.

## The Mythical Man-Month Meets the Agentic Swarm
Fred Brooks famously noted that "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later" because of the exponential growth of communication overhead (n(n-1)/2).

### The math is changing.
With AI agents, we are effectively reversing the curve. We can now produce the output of a 10-person team with a 2-person squad and an agentic stack. When the team size drops, the coordination tax vanishes. You don’t need a "Scrum of Scrums" when there is no "other" Scrum team to sync with. You don't need a Release Train when your "QA Engineer" is an agent that validates every commit in seconds.

### Ceremonies are for Humans (and Agents don't care)
The rituals of Scrum were designed to fix information asymmetry. We met for 15 minutes every morning because we didn't know what our colleagues were doing.

In an agent-integrated workflow, information is ambient:
- The Stand-up is Dead: Why talk about what you did when an agent has already summarized the PRs, updated the documentation, and flagged the blockers in a real-time dashboard?
- Sprint Planning is Obsolete: Estimation was always a guess at human "effort." Agents don't have "effort"; they have "tokens and compute." We are moving toward Intent-Based Development, where we define the what and the agents handle the how.
- The Scrum Master is a Script: The role of "unblocking the team" is being cannibalized by orchestration layers like LangGraph and CrewAI that manage task hand-offs automatically.

### The Dead Weight of SAFe
If you are still running PI Planning sessions in a world where agents can generate a functional prototype from a prompt, you are operating at the wrong speed.
The "Agile Industrial Complex" was built on the assumption that software development is a factory line. But AI has turned it back into a craft. The future belongs to the "Surgical Team"—small, elite groups that use agents to amplify their intent.

*"Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential." — Agile Manifesto*

## Moving Forward: Principles > Frameworks
Does this mean Agility is dead? No. It means the Frameworks are dead.
The core principles—responding to change, working software, and technical excellence—are more vital than ever. But the "theatre" of agile is over. If your process requires more time in Jira than in the IDE, you're not being agile; you're just being slow.
The "Release Train" is a relic of the industrial age. It's time to get off the train and start flying.
