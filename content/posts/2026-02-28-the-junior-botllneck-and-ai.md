A younger friend recently asked me a question that, for the first time in my career, I didn't have a ready answer for: "Does it still make sense to study Computer Science?"
They wanted to know if it’s still a "good investment." I sat with that for a moment. AI is clearly the elephant in the room, and while we know the role of humans in this industry is changing, predicting the what and the how feels like trying to debug a race condition in the dark.

## The Ever-Moving Baseline
The role of a developer has always evolved. When I was a Junior, I spent a non-trivial amount of time writing string classes in C++. Today, that would be a waste of company resources. We add abstraction after abstraction, and our job moves "up the stack."
But this time, the abstraction isn't just a new library; it's a co-pilot.
## The Short-Term: A Structural Squeeze
My observation that AI is hitting junior hiring isn't just a "vibe"—the data is starting to back it up. Traditionally, teams were a mix of Senior, Mid, and Junior devs. Juniors took on the "toilsome" but necessary tasks, learning the ropes under supervision.
Now, Seniors with AI are doing those tasks themselves in half the time. A 2025 study by Alicia Sasser Modestino found a 16.3% drop in the relative demand for junior versus senior developers since the AI boom began. We are essentially automating the "training wheels" of our industry. This creates a terrifying bottleneck: if we don't hire juniors today, where do the seniors of 2030 come from?

## It’s Not Just AI—It’s the Bill
However, we can't blame everything on the LLMs. Overall, financials are hitting headcount harder than any bot. Companies are currently obsessed with investing in Data Center capacity to win the AI arms race.
Reports from RationalFX indicate that while tech layoffs surpassed 244,000 in 2025, a huge driver was a "structural reset." Money that used to go toward hiring a diverse team is being diverted into GPUs and electricity. Between stock market instability and the sheer cost of building the "brains" of AI, the budget for human "hands" is being squeezed.

## The Long-Term: Two Possible Futures
Where does this end? I see two paths:
### The Explosion: 
The need for software is infinite. Even with god-tier AI, you need human supervision to ensure the logic holds. Plus, there is the growing "vibe coding" crowd—people using AI to ship products they don't fully understand. Someone is going to have to maintain, fix, and untangle those "half-done" hallucinations.
### The Relic: 
Tools become so good that domain expertise is all that matters. In this world, the "Software Developer" becomes a specialist relic—someone who can explain how the computer actually works, even if nobody cares as long as the app runs.

## Why I’d Still Do It
In the end, I told my friend this: I was lucky. I knew what I wanted to do before it was trendy or high-paying. It was just fun.
Computer Science might be a harder "investment" now. The ramp-up is steeper, and your role might look more like an AI Supervisor than a traditional software craftsman. But the core of it—solving problems and building things out of pure logic—is still there. I would do it again in a heartbeat. Even if I have to spend my days arguing with a model instead of a compiler.
