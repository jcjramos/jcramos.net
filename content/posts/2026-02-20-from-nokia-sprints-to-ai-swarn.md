The "Nokia Test" and the Golden Age of Scrum The last post, [The Death of the Agile Industrial Complex: A Full Circle](../2026-02-16-agile-is-dead.md), made me nostalgic for 2008. At the time, I was at Nokia (NSN), and the company made a massive pivot to Scrum. We even had Jeff Sutherland, the inventor of the ["Nokia Test"](https://jeffsutherland.com/nokiatest.pdf), guiding us.  
Transitioning from waterfall to Scrum was challenging, but the impact was undeniable. My team’s score on the Nokia Test jumped from a 3/10 to a 9/10 in just a few months. In that era of massive 4G telco transformations, Scrum wasn't just a framework; it was a lifeline that helped huge teams navigate immense complexity. I truly liked it—it brought a human spirit back to software development.  
## The Bridge to 2026: 
Why the Math Has Changed However, looking back from 2026, I realize that the very ceremonies that saved us at Nokia are becoming the "dead weight" I described in my previous post. As I noted in Ceremonies are for Humans (and Agents don't care), we met every morning because we didn't know what our colleagues were doing. But in a world of Agentic Swarms, information is ambient.  
## Principles Over Rituals 
I still value the spirit of those early Nokia days—the focus on the team and the feedback loop. But we must admit that the "Agile Industrial Complex" we built afterward was a solution for human communication at scale. Now that AI is reversing the communication curve, we don't need the heavy scaffolds of the past.  
Scrum was the right tool for the 4G transformation, but for the AI revolution, we need to return to being "Surgical Teams" —elite, small groups that use agents to amplify intent. It’s time to take the lessons from the Nokia Test but leave the "Uppercase Agile" theatre behind.
