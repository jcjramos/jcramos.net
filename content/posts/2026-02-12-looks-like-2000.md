If you stay in this industry long enough, the "unprecedented" starts to look very familiar. History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes
Lately, the air feels thick with the same electricity I remember from the late 90s. Back then, I was already a few years into my career, watching the world lose its mind over the "Dotcom" revolution. Today, I see history rhyming with the AI boom.

### The Era of Slideware
In 2000, we had "slideware"—products that only existed in PowerPoint decks, backed by valuations that assumed we had rewritten the laws of physics. People were throwing millions at companies with no revenue and "growth at all costs" manifestos.
Sound familiar?
Today, I see the same pattern. I see "AI startups" on Reddit and LinkedIn claiming to automate entire engineering departments with a single prompt. I see investors rushing into "wrapper" companies that have no moats, no unique data, and—most importantly—no accountability.

### The "Right, but Early" Trap
The most interesting thing about the 2000 crash wasn't that the ideas were wrong. Most of them were right.
- We predicted we’d buy our groceries online (Webvan).
- We predicted we’d stream movies (AOL/Time Warner).
- We predicted the "Always On" mobile internet.

The ideas were sound, but the timing was off and the infrastructure was missing. A lot of companies went bust not because they lacked vision, but because they ran out of cash waiting for the world to catch up.
AI feels identical in 2026. The shift to natural language as the "final abstraction" is real. The productivity gains are real. But the "instant revolution" promised in the current slideware? That will likely take a decade longer than the hype suggests. Why? Because Software is still limited by physics.

### The Hard Wall of 2026
I don't know exactly what is coming in the next few years, but I know it won't be as fast as the slides suggest.
While AI models are evolving in months, our physical world moves in years. We are hitting a hard wall of electricity and infrastructure. You can't "prompt" a new power grid into existence. You can't "vibe code" a 1-Gigawatt data center.
In regions like Ireland, we are seeing data centers consume nearly a third of the national power supply. We are seeing seven-year wait times for grid interconnections. No matter how "great" a model is, its growth is bound by how much electricity we can generate and how many physical buildings we can cool.
The Survival Guide

### If 2000 taught me anything, it's this:
- Infrastructure Wins First: In 2000, the winners were the ones building the pipes (Cisco, and eventually the Cloud). Today, it’s the ones building the storage and compute.
- Accountability is the Moat: Anyone can generate 1,000 lines of code with an LLM. Not everyone can explain why that code works, how it scales, or how to fix it when it breaks at 3:00 AM.
- Beware the "AI" Label: Adding ".com" to your name in 1999 didn't make you a business. 



The models are ready. The slides are beautiful. But the infrastructure will take its time. Until then, the best thing we can do is stay in the loop, keep our eyes on the architecture, and remember that even in the age of AI, you can't abstract away the laws of physics.
