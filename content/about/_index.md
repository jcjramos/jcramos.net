My name is José Ramos, I was born in the sunny streets of Lisbon/Portugal, but these days you'll find me navigating the tech landscape of Dublin/Ireland.  
A long time ago, during the 80s in the last millennium, I received a Sinclair ZX Spectrum as a gift.
I don’t know exactly when, as I never kept a diary, but I remember that instead of playing Pac-Man as my friends did, I became fascinated by how you could write a few commands and that tiny machine would do so many interesting things (I was an odd kid...). Soon, I bought a book about BASIC in a used bookstore and started learning it. I eventually discovered that I loved doing that and wanted to make it my career.
From BASIC to the Cloud
Although I don’t use BASIC much these days, I still love the art of programming. Over the decades, I’ve navigated the shifts from the local machines of the 90s to the massive, distributed systems of today.
Professionally, I’ve been in the software industry for over 30 years. Currently I work as a Software Engineering Manager at Google Cloud, where I work on Cloud Storage.

**The 2026 Shift: Abstraction & AI**
In 2018, I focused this blog on Security and Privacy—issues I still believe are foundational to our lives as software integrates into our cars, power grids, and homes. However, my focus has recently shifted toward the next great challenge: AI and the Evolution of Communication.
I’ve spent a lot of my career in Java, C++, and more recently, managing infrastructure. But today, I’m fascinated by how the "syntax tax" of coding is disappearing. We are returning to that feeling I had with the ZX Spectrum—simply telling a machine what to do—only now, we are doing it in natural language.

## Beyond the Screen 
I don't program as much as I used to; some days I’m using more "managerial tools" than an IDE, but I remain deeply involved in the development process. When I’m not thinking about storage architecture or AI, I’m usually:
- Trying to improve my Chess rating (currently around 1000 on Chess.com—reminding me that I’m still a student at heart).
- Listening to history podcasts like The Rest is History, looking for patterns that help explain where our industry is headed next.
This blog is where I document those patterns—from the 8 bit era to the AI era.


## Some additional comments :

Keep in mind that English is not my first language, I’m a native Portuguese speaker, please don’t be offended if my use of English looks “odd”. Recently Gemini gives me a hand reviwing my posts. 

## Some credits for this site : 

This blog name is a obvious inspiration from the well know ( and very interesting to read for many years ) blog Schneier on Security https://www.schneier.com/.

## New home on GitHub
Originally this blog was hosted in wordpress, in the end of 2018 I've decided to move it to Cloudflare + github and use a static generator ( https://www.gohugo.io ) to manage it. Reasonin is that this way I can handle the blog with much of the same tools that I use in everyday Software development. A plus is that the Markdown format is quite good to handle code examples, and I plan to focus on tuturials and technical aspects.
