      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve found out this week that the famous &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/&#34;&gt;Joel test&lt;/a&gt; reached 19 years of age this month, besides reminding me how old I’m getting  it reminded me of the importance of proper CI/CD - [Continuous Integration] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration&lt;/a&gt;) / [Continuous Delivery] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery&lt;/a&gt;) pipelines in software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time I’ve came across “Joel Test”, found that comply with rule number 2 migth be a good thing and I’ve tried to create a simple build script that would emulate a kind of basic CI pipe – at the time I was working on a application composed of a set of components based on Win32 DLL’s+EXE; my CI script would compile the necessary DLL’s, join them in a directory and check if it run. Seems and it’s quite basic but it was really helpful, you would be surprised by how many times things got messed up, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell&#34;&gt;Dependency_hell&lt;/a&gt; Someone ? , I was convinced how valuable was this early feedback tool, thus have been a fan of CI/CD for the rest and most part of my professional live.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I’ve come across a post in Quora about the “end of Java”, kind of funny these doomsday predictions regarding programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve starting to learn programming somewhere around the late 80’s when I was a kid, at the time I’ve learn basic … it was the most common language for kids who owned “PC’s” with 48k of memory. Basic programs tended to be quite difficult to read and one thing that you learn from experience ( sometimes the hard way ) is that it is generally much difficult to maintain and evolve computer software than to initially write it, thus putting effort in to make it clean and adaptable pays off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
