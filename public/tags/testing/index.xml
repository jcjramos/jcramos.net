      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyday there is a new story about a hacking incident somewhere, developing secure applications is definitely one of the most important challenges in the software world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good analogy is the defence of a castle, in the medieval world castles were very important. In a anarchic world with many threads  they were the centres of power and stability. But how to defend a castle from your enemy’s ? a well built castle in a high point was a clear advantage, will a relatively small force it could be defended against a much powerful enemy.
But as a defended you had to make sure that you didn’t miss any spot, the enemy would look for weak points and you would have to make sure that you had none. Defences must be built and then continuously maintained and updated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
