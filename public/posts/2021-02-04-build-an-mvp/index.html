MVP stands for minimum viable product, and it is a popular thing between Agile software developers. A MVP  is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development. Software developers typically deploy the product to a subset of possible customers to get feedback and be able to grasp a proper product vision. Then with the collected feedback they improve the product and create a more evolved MVP, tough several interactions until they get to a kind of “final” release.">

<p>MVP stands for minimum viable product, and it is a popular thing between Agile software developers. A MVP  is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development. Software developers typically deploy the product to a subset of possible customers to get feedback and be able to grasp a proper product vision. Then with the collected feedback they improve the product and create a more evolved MVP, tough several interactions until they get to a kind of “final” release.</p>
<p>Regarding MVPs I’ve recently come across many illustrations like this one.</p>
<p><img alt="MVP" loading="lazy" src="/images/MVP.jpg"></p>
<p>That claim that there’s a “right way” to build an MVP, looking at the illustration it seems that it makes a lot of sense that you go with the 3rd option.</p>
<p>The problem is that real life is not so simple and create software is HARD.</p>
<p>Let remember an example; everybody and their dog is on Instagram these days – before been part of Facebook Instagram was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. The fun part is that they start by creating a “mobile check-in app&quot; called Burbn somewhere around 2010, when they noticed that for one side there was lots of competition, on the other users seem to like updating photos from their phones and sharing them ( a feature that existed in Burbn … ). Then they decided to dump Burbn and refocus on creating a very cool photo sharing app.</p>
<p>The interesting part, and that is a common story with many of the existing popular software applications is that in the beginning they simply didn’t know what they were doing – they created an MVP for something that they tough would be interesting, but then they “inspect &amp; adapt” and come up with something quite cool but completely diferent. That’s real live software development, you create something, then you try it, then you found out that it is not quite right or that those creative users found a different way to use it and then you re-implement part of it ( often you simple delete the other part …) and came up with something cool.</p>
<p>In an ideal world you would know what is the “end goal” and implement several interactions of MVP’s that would take your product in the right direction. They problem is that in real life often you don’t know what the right direction is. Actually the “right way” to build an MVP can be a bit “waterfall like”, meaning that you know a lot of your end product up front – then you spend a lot of time planning it and there’s often now a good way to create something new and innovative.</p>
<p>I’ve come across an interesting experience in a very nice book I’ve read sometime ago called “dreaming in code” that tells the story of a personal information management suite, developed somewhere in the early 2000’s called chandler. Chandler counted with a talented development team, but actually never was a successful product – reading the book chandler story seems a bit like the “right way” to build a MVP; up front they knew that they wanted a kind “Microsoft Exchange on Steroids” and simple it takes a quite long time to do it right. Even if you have enough funding to implement everything that you dream, the world changes and it might not be very useful or popular when you finished.</p>
<p>I think one could adapt to Agile the famous quote from Wiston Churchill ( about democracy ) “Agile is the worst form of Creating Software except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.…&quot;</p>
<p>So, if you are creating a Software product, do create a MVP ! just don’t expect that there’s a right way to do it and beware of others claiming that.</p>
