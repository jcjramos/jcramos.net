      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the scope on the GDPR there was some recent news in Portugal regarding Government guidelines for online public services. Atually public service security is an important issue as in Portugal we have lot’s of personal info in public sites, for example a service call eFactura stores basically every invoice where you have put a VAT number – thus very valuable info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines are still under discussion, but a kind of pre-release showed up today in todays specialized press. Some of the measurements are basic security common sense like “Usage of plain text credentials in code or configuration files is forbidden” or  “there should be a access control policy defined”. Others are a bit odd like “Passwords should have a minimum length of 9 characters using lower and uppercase, numbers and special characters”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
