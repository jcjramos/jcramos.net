      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was a 47 hour oddity; across Europe it is like this every last weekend of March due to the annual DST change to “Summer Hour”. It is annoying but I know if could be worse, at least these changes are unified and regulated, thus all the counties that are part of the EU &amp;ldquo;unified clock regime&amp;rdquo; make the change in the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes tend to remind me of years ago when I’ve worked in a software that processed Television audiences, what to do with the GAP when the clock jumps from SAT 1:00 AM to SAT 2:00 AM ? in our case we have decided to “duplicate” the 0:00 to 1:00 period, but a dedicated routine was written in C++ to handle it. Not actually an easy task…jumping time doesn’t make life easy for software developers, in particular if the software somehow relates to continuous time related data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
