      <title>Developing Secure Applications</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyday there is a new story about a hacking incident somewhere, developing secure applications is definitely one of the most important challenges in the software world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good analogy is the defence of a castle, in the medieval world castles were very important. In a anarchic world with many threads  they were the centres of power and stability. But how to defend a castle from your enemy’s ? a well built castle in a high point was a clear advantage, will a relatively small force it could be defended against a much powerful enemy.
But as a defended you had to make sure that you didn’t miss any spot, the enemy would look for weak points and you would have to make sure that you had none. Defences must be built and then continuously maintained and updated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>About Bitcoin, Cryptocurrencies and Cryptomining</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;The current cryptocurrency trend brings fresh challenges to security, and should be a concern even if you, like me don’t understand where’s the fun of Bitcoin and don’t care much about it.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Cryptocurrencies were one of the greatest trends in 2017, in particular the crypto “star” Bitcoin that started the year around 1000$ and ended it well above 10000$. Although I really don’t find Bitcoin particularly interesting ( just go elsewhere if you are looking for investment tips – I’m not really good at it ) I think that the concept behind it, Blockchain, has potential and can be useful in a lot of different ways.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;For several reasons Meltdown and Spectre are a very interesting set of vulnerabilities that illustrates well the challenges involved to create secure software applications these days.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
